/***
    Given a bipartite graph, you have to check if there exists a matching that contains
    all the nodes of the left side.

    Let X be any subset of the nodes of left side. Let f(X) be the set of their neighbours.
    If, |X| <= |f(X)| holds for all X, the a matching is possible satisfying the condition above.
